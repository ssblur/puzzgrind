# Puzzgrind
*(Tentative name)

Puzzgrind is a block-matching puzzle game made using characters from [Railgrind](https://www.railgrindgame.com/).

It's super simple! Pick up a block and move it to match 3 or more blocks of the same color. 
When you make a match, any adjacent garbage blocks will also be cleared.
More lines are added to the bottom as you go, and as you match more they pop out faster

And that's it! 
Hope you enjoy, and be sure to check out [Railgrind](https://www.railgrindgame.com/), the premiere racing card game.
